# GalaxySim

In this project the goal was to implement a very simplified model of galaxy collisions, motivated by work due
to Alar and Juri Toomre in the early 1970â€™s. This model is grossly inadequate for the detailed simulation
of galaxy interactions but nevertheless capable of reproducing some basic morphological features that are
observed in actual galactic collisions.
